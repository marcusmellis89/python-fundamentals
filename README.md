## python-fundamentals
###Repository for fundamental python concepts, techniques and excercises

This is a repository for python code I write will gaining a solid fundamental of the language. The exercise will be coming
mainly from codecademy, learning python the hard way, dive into python, and google's python course. I'm not quite sure the format or the overall direction this repository will take. This is mainly for personal use but feel free to take a look around. I'll be updating this readme as I progress.
